# Travel-Website


This Website is useful for the projects for students in engineering.

This a travel-website, 
I have used html,css, bootstrap for the front-end development, and php, mysql for the backend development.
What actually exists in this website template is,  In the user side, one can see the packages that a travel agency is providing with in INDIA, and can book them. Also some people gets confused when they want to travel, so we here is the solution we suggest some places according to the occasion or mood of the travellers.

In the Admin -side admin can see the bookings that are made and also the the number of registrations made through the website.

I have used Xampp server mysql for the database, to store the information of the users and also the admins.

 This will be a basic template and can also be further modified a lot!
